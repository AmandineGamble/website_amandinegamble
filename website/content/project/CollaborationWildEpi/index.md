I collaborate with field biologists to study the dynamics of infectious agents across wild populations. I notably work with the Antarctic Wildlife Health Working Group of the [Expert Group on Birds and Marine Mammals (EG-BAMM)](https://www.scar.org/science/eg-bamm/home/) of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.
