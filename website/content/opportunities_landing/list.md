In January 2024, I will start a research group studying pathogen dynamics in multihost systems from the <a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments/public-ecosystem-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Department of Public & Ecosystem Health at Cornell University**</a> (in Ithaca, Upstate New York). I am looking for **postdocs and students** to join our group. You can find out more about our research themes and my contact details on this website - if you are inspired by our research and are into **field ecology**, **molecular biology** and/or **mathematical modeling**, please feel free to reach out! Some of the questions we aim to explore in the future include: How are pathogens introduced to remote islands? What is the role of human activities and introduced species in their spread and maintenance? What is their impact on native species? 

In addition to ongoing funded projects, opportunities for postdoc funding include:
