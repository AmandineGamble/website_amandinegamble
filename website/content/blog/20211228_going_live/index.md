Welcome!

I generated this website directly from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) using the `blogdown` package and following the tutorial provided in [***blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown***](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). It is all free, and relatively easy to use thanks to this amazing step-by-step tutorial. Highly recommended! 

For the structure and design of the website, I picked the [**Academic Theme**](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I then did a bit of customization taking inspiration from [**Olivier Gimenez' website**](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/) and messing around with the different files to make it fit exactly to my needs. Finally, I uploaded everything on [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/).

Among the features I added on top of the default Academic template:
- Some of the basic Hugo personalization options such as [extra landing pages](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/landing-pages/) 
- Citation metrics with [**Dimensions**](https://badge.dimensions.ai/) and [**Altmetric**](https://api.altmetric.com/embeds.html) embedded badges
- Embedded [**Google maps**](https://www.igismap.com/embed-google-map-with-multiple-locations/)

If needed, you can find the code used to generate this website on [**my GitHub**](https://github.com/AmandineGamble/amandinegamble_website).
