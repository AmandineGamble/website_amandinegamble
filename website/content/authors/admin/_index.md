I am interested in the processes underlying the circulation of infectious agents among hosts. As mechanisms occurring at different scales (through time, space and biological systems) interact together to drive epidemiological dynamics, my main research interest is in the development of methods allowing efficient data integration to identify and quantify these processes.

During my PhD (supervised by <a href="https://thierryboulinier.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Thierry Boulinier</a>, CEFE - CNRS/Montpellier University), I explored in which conditions and how serological data can be used to efficiently infer the underlying processes of infectious agent circulation and their effects on hosts in wild populations. For this, I combined observational and experimental data collected in various seabird-parasite systems with theoretical approaches. 

My current research as postdoc in the <a href="https://faculty.eeb.ucla.edu/lloydsmith/index.php" target="_blank">Lloyd-Smith Lab</a> as part of the <a href="https://batonehealth.org/" target="_blank">BatOneHealth project</a> aims at designing quantitative methods to integrate data collected in the lab and in the field, at scales from molecules to communities, with the goal of developing biological insight and practical predictors of the epidemiological dynamics of bat-borne viruses.
